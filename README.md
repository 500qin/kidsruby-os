# KidsRuby

The [KidsRuby](http://kidsruby.com) project provides a way that kids can use the awesome [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) learning software [Hackety Hack](http://hackety-hack.com) anywhere they go, just bring their own USB drive, plug in, and reboot.

Have fun and make games, or hack your homework using Ruby!
Just tell your parents or teachers you're learning Ruby programming... ;)

KidsRuby is free and works on any computer.
